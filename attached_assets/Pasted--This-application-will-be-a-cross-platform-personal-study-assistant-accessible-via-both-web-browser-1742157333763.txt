"This application will be a cross-platform personal study assistant, accessible via both web browsers and mobile devices, designed to empower students to excel in their courses, wherever they are. The core functionality remains focused on transforming static syllabi into dynamic, actionable study plans directly integrated into their calendars. Users can begin by uploading their class syllabi as PDF documents, conveniently from their device storage on mobile or via drag-and-drop on the web platform. Regardless of the platform, the application leverages the power of the Gemini 2.0 Flash API to perform intelligent syllabus analysis. This AI-driven analysis goes beyond simple data extraction, identifying key dates (due dates, exams, deadlines, holidays, course start/end) with year inference, categorizing assignment types (homework, quizzes, exams, projects, etc.), and pinpointing crucial course topics and lecture titles. Robust error handling will ensure a seamless and reliable experience during this AI processing, whether accessed through a browser or mobile app. The application then intelligently generates personalized learning plans, not just listing dates, but providing clear guidance on when and how to study effectively. These plans are built upon advanced spaced repetition algorithms, tailored to the user's chosen study cadence (from 'Relaxed' to 'Intense'), ensuring optimal retention and preparation across all platforms. The learning plans are presented in an intuitive and accessible format, offering daily, weekly, and list views, providing a clear roadmap for success on both web and mobile interfaces. The most crucial feature is the seamless, direct integration with the user's personal calendar (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook Calendar). Upon user authorization, the application proactively creates calendar events directly within their chosen calendar. These events are not just reminders of deadlines, but act as active nudges and prompts, scheduling study sessions and highlighting important dates. These calendar entries serve as tangible, actionable steps for the user to follow, providing clear direction on when to engage with course material, accessible and actionable from their calendar on any device. Users retain agency by being able to customize calendar event settings, including reminders and choosing their preferred calendar, consistently across web and mobile. To reinforce positive study habits, the application delivers timely push notifications for upcoming study sessions and approaching deadlines on mobile devices, with user-configurable notification settings, while web users can access reminders within the application interface and potentially through browser notifications. Progress tracking is integrated to allow users to monitor their study session completion and progress towards course milestones, with basic analytics providing insights into study time allocation and workload, viewable on both web and mobile. User profiles, managed through Firebase Authentication, allow for personalized settings including study cadence, calendar integration preferences, and notification options, ensuring the application adapts to individual student needs across both platforms. Underpinning all of this is a robust and user-friendly UI/UX, professionally designed for intuitive navigation, visual engagement, and responsive layout, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable experience whether accessed via web browser or mobile app. This application is laser-focused on transforming syllabi into actionable calendar-based study guidance, empowering students with the direction and reminders they need to excel, explicitly excluding features like collaboration, AI content summarization, and syllabus text editing, ensuring a streamlined and focused experience on both web and mobile."
