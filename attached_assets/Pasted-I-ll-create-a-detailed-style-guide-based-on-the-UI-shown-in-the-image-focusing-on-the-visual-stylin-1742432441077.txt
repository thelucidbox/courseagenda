I'll create a detailed style guide based on the UI shown in the image, focusing on the visual styling elements rather than the specific content or layout.

# ProdigyLearn UI Style Guide

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors
- **Purple**: A vibrant purple (#7209B7 or similar) used for primary UI elements, buttons, and section backgrounds
- **Yellow/Orange**: A bright yellow-orange (#FFB627 or similar) used for accents, highlights, and secondary buttons
- **White**: Clean white (#FFFFFF) for background and text areas

### Secondary Colors
- **Light Purple**: A softer purple for borders and secondary elements
- **Light Blue**: Pale blue accents (#E2F0FF or similar) for some decorative elements
- **Light Yellow**: Pale yellow for minor accents

## Typography

### Headings
- **Primary Font**: Sans-serif font family (appears to be a rounded sans-serif like Poppins or similar)
- **Weight**: Bold/Heavy (600-800) for main headings
- **Color**: Dark gray/almost black (#1A1A1A) for maximum readability
- **Style**: Clean with generous letter-spacing

### Body Text
- **Font**: Same sans-serif family as headings but in regular weight (400)
- **Size**: Multiple tiers (16px for primary content, 14px for secondary content)
- **Line Height**: Approximately 1.5-1.6× the font size for good readability
- **Color**: Dark gray (#333333) for body text, lighter gray (#666666) for secondary text

## UI Elements

### Cards/Content Blocks
- **Shape**: Rounded corners (12-16px radius) on all card elements
- **Shadow**: Subtle drop shadows (4-8px blur, very low opacity)
- **Border**: Either no visible border or very subtle light borders
- **Background**: White or very light backgrounds for content areas

### Buttons
- **Primary Button**: Purple background (#7209B7) with white text, rounded corners (24-30px radius, making them pill-shaped)
- **Secondary Button**: White or transparent with purple border and purple text
- **Padding**: Generous padding (16-20px horizontal, 10-12px vertical)
- **Hover State**: Slight darkening or brightening effect (not visible in static image)

### Icons
- **Style**: Simple, modern line icons with occasional filled elements
- **Color**: Primarily in the purple or yellow-orange of the brand palette
- **Size**: Proportional to nearby text (approximately 24px)

## Visual Styling Techniques

### Decorative Elements
- **Floating Shapes**: Small decorative elements (stars, crosses, circles) in brand colors floating around content areas
- **Gradient Overlays**: Subtle gradient overlays on some sections (particularly purple to slightly darker purple)

### Image Treatment
- **Content Images**: Appear within rounded rectangle containers or cut into rounded shapes
- **People Photos**: Natural, authentic-looking photos of people using the product
- **Overlapping Elements**: Slight overlapping of elements for depth (images slightly overlapping card borders)

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Spacing**: Generous white space between sections (40-60px)
- **Section Separation**: Clear visual separation between different content sections
- **Emphasis**: Key elements highlighted with color, size, or position

## Component-Specific Styling

### Feature Cards
- **Container**: Square or slightly rectangular with heavily rounded corners (16-20px)
- **Background**: Deep purple (#7209B7) with white text
- **Icons**: Yellow-orange circular icon containers with white icons
- **Numbering**: Large, bold numbering in yellow-orange

### Testimonial Section
- **Quotes**: Light background cards with subtle shadow
- **User Images**: Small circular profile images
- **Rating**: Yellow-orange stars for ratings
- **Border**: No visible border, but clear shadow to define the card edges

### Image Showcases
- **Container Shape**: Rounded rectangle or square with heavily rounded corners
- **Border**: No visible border, but defined with shadow or background color change
- **Position**: Often slightly angled or with a tilted perspective for dynamism
- **Overlap**: Elements frequently overlap slightly with decorative elements

## Overall Feel & Design Philosophy

- **Playful Professional**: Professional enough for an educational product but with playful elements
- **Airy Layout**: Generous white space creating an open, uncluttered feel
- **Dynamic Elements**: Slight rotation of elements, floating decorations, and overlapping components create energy
- **Rounded Softness**: Almost everything has rounded corners, creating a friendly, approachable feel
- **Consistent Brand**: The purple and yellow-orange appear consistently throughout all major elements

## Animation Hints (based on static image inference)
- **Hover Effects**: Likely subtle scaling (1.02-1.05×) on cards and buttons
- **Transitions**: Soft transitions between states (0.2-0.3s duration)
- **Micro-interactions**: Decorative elements might have subtle floating animations

This style guide should help your engineer implement the visual language of this UI while allowing flexibility for your different application content.
